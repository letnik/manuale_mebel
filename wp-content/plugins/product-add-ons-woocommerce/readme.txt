Create Customized Product Add-Ons for WooCommerce Products to Expand Product Options for the Customer.
== Description ==

Create customized Product Add-Ons for WooCommerce Products. If a Simple or Variable Product doesn't provide the flexibility of options you need to sell a product, use Product Add-ons. You can add Product Add-Ons to only a select Product, select Category or a selection of both Products and Categories. Plus add a Product Add-on to apply to All Products in your WooCommerce Store. The Product Add-on can be shown to the customer in several ways: A Checkbox, A Radio Button, A Selection or a Text Field. Depending on your Product Add-on you can choose which style of option best fits your product requirements. How does it work? You have a t-shirt WooCommerce store. You create a product: Graphic Tee as a Variable Product with sizes: S, M, L, and XL. Use Product Add-ons to allow the customer to add a custom Text to the shirt. OR select a different Graphic image. OR Color of the Shirt. Product Add-ons can include a price too! You can decide to sell the Yellow t-shirt for a higher price than the White t-shirt selection. The possibilities are endless to use Product Add-ons to customizes what the customer can add to your product and upsell Add-On options to Products. Product Add-ons help you avoid back and forth emails after the customer purchases the Product.
